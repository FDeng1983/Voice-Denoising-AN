**Abstract:** An Adverserial Network (AN) was designed for the task of source de-noising of noise voice auditory images. The AN inputs set-length short-time Fourier Transform (STFT) magnitude features of the noisy speech and returns a denoised image that can be converted to the time-domain via IFFT. The dataset is created by randomly combined TIMIT speaker samples and stationary or non-stationary noise. For non-stationary noise, Duan et al.'s dataset is used: http://www2.ece.rochester.edu/~zduan/data/noise/.
